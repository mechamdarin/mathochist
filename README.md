My name is Darin Mecham. Welcome to my GitHub! 

If you're here to check out my work, refer to the "Projects" folder. There, you will see various coding projects that I have done in the past. [breakdown.md](https://github.com/mechamdarin/mathochist/blob/master/Projects/breakdown.md) in that folder will... well, "break down" what is going on there. 

# About Me

* I am a Biostatistics graduate (Fall 2018 - Winter 2023). 
* I am originally from a small town in Northern Montana.
* I like long walks on the beach and I *occasionally* take things seriously.
