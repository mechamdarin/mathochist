# Intro Message

This is my projects directory! There are quite a few files in here from my time at Brigham Young University - Idaho (Fall 2018 - Winter 2023). All of the data that I use in here was either provided to my fellow classmates and me for our assignments, or it was collected by yours truly. **Please keep this in mind.** 

# DOE (Design of Experiments) Glossary

There is a file in here that does not pertain to analyzing data or even visualizing it. The DOE Glossary is a collection of items that I have found to be helpful over the years. You will find that it is most helpful when it comes to ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) testing.

# Warnings...

## Aesthetics

Due to my fondness of the library(pander), there will be a few things that will look *absolutely* not good in the .md files. If you want to see them in their true form, I recommend downloading the .Rmd file and knitting it in the IDE of your choosing (knit to .html).  

## Professionalism

There are certainly some times when my "professional statistical language" is a little lax. For that, I warn, but I do not apologize. 



# What's in here?

As I mentioned earlier, this directory contains files from my time during my undergrad at BYU-I. As such, you will find some of my work pertaining to basic statistics tests (t-tests, One-Way ANOVA, etc.) as well as experiments of my own design.
