# Intro Message

This is my projects directory! There are quite a few files in here from my time at Brigham Young University - Idaho (Fall 2018 - Winter 2023). All of the data that I use in here was either collected by yours truly, or it was provided to my fellow classmates and me for our assignments. **Please keep this in mind.** 

# DOE (Design of Experiments) Glossary

There is a file in here that does not pertain to analyzing data or even visualizing it. The DOE Glossary is a collection of items that I have found to be helpful over the years. You will find that it is most helpful when it comes to ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) testing.
